# [Threads](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html)
## What is a Thread? 

Within a program, a thread is a separate execution path. It is a lightweight process that the operating system can schedule and run concurrently with other threads. The operating system creates and manages threads, and they share the same memory and resources as the program that created them. This enables multiple threads to collaborate and work efficiently within a single program.

## Why Multithreading? 

A thread is also known as lightweight process. The idea is to achieve parallelism by dividing a process into multiple threads. For example, in a browser, multiple tabs can be different threads. MS Word uses multiple threads: one thread to format the text, another thread to process inputs, etc. More advantages of multithreading are discussed below.
